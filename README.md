Crop Recommendation System

This project is a machine learning-based **Crop Recommendation System** that suggests the most suitable crop to cultivate based on various soil and environmental parameters.

Project Structure

This notebook contains:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Crop prediction logic



 Features

- Takes inputs like **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH**, and **Rainfall**
- Recommends the **best crop** to grow based on ML model predictions
- Includes multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
- Accuracy comparison between models

 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)



1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
